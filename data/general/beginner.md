Entering the gym for the first time can be daunting, but remember, everyone has been in your position at one point. You might be surprised at how common some of these anxiety-focused thoughts and feelings actually are.
For many people, stepping onto a gym floor is as scary as the first day of school. But however out of place you feel when starting out in the gym, be assured that you're not alone.
Let’s help you put some of those worries to one side so you can focus on your workout.
1. "I don’t know how anything works"
It might seem like everyone else knows what they're doing, but they all had to start somewhere.
From your first visit to pick up your membership card, you can organise a gym induction. This is run by a qualified member of the fitness team, who'll take you through everything you need to know about the gym, including how to use the equipment and machines.
2. "I look silly and different"
There really is no such thing as ‘looking the part’ at the gym.
Bear in mind that people from all backgrounds, and of all shapes and sizes use the gym. Everyone will have different goals and abilities, so comparing how you look, or what you’re doing, to others won’t get you anywhere.
Remember: everyone sweats and everyone’s body jiggles about to a certain extent – it means you’re working hard. If you’re not sure what kit you'll need to bring, check out our pointers on what to wear when you work out.
3. "I’m not fit enough to be here"
Everyone is welcome in the gym. It doesn’t make a difference whether you’re training for a marathon, recovering from injury, or you’ve never done a sit-up in your life.
If you’ve joined the gym to make changes or learn something new, then walking through the front door is the most important step. And you have every right to be on the gym floor, in an exercise class, or using the pool, no matter what you look like or what you're capable of.
To get started, we suggest you try a little of everything, even if you don't think it's 'for you'. You never know, you might find you have a flair for Zumba, a passion for indoor cycling, or that you feel stronger by using the weight machines.
4. "I don’t know what I’m doing"
This is one of the most common concerns people have. It’s easy to have good intentions, but translating those into results can be tricky if you don’t know the ropes. Understanding how best to work out for your goals and your body is key to confidence.
Why not choose and follow a guided workout? Lots of people print off or write down their workout routine, so it's perfectly normal to carry a prompt sheet with you while you workout, or look at it on your phone.
If you need a bit of support, attending a class with a friend is a great idea as it can keep you motivated. If you and your friend use the gym floor, don't just copy what they do, make sure you do exercises that suit you.

Starting a fitness journey is exciting, but let’s face it, navigating the gym as a beginner can feel overwhelming. From improper form to unrealistic expectations, a common beginner fitness mistake is diving in without a plan, beginner fitness foundation mistakes can slow progress and even lead to injuries. The good news? You don’t have to learn the hard way!
Here are the most common beginner fitness mistakes make and the best workout tips for beginners to help you train smarter and see results faster.
1. Skipping Warm-Ups and Cool-Downs

Mistake: Jumping straight into a workout without warming up or heading out the door right after your last set without cooling down.

Why It’s a Problem: A proper warm-up preps your muscles, improves circulation, and reduces the risk of injury. Cooling down helps prevent soreness and aids recovery.

Fix It: Spend 5–10 minutes warming up with dynamic stretches or light cardio (think jumping jacks or brisk walking). After your workout, cool down with static stretches to improve flexibility.

2. Ignoring Proper Form

Mistake: Lifting weights with incorrect posture or using momentum instead of muscle control.

Why It’s a Problem: Poor form can lead to strain, imbalances, and injuries, especially in compound movements like squats and deadlifts.

Fix It: Prioritise how to improve form over lifting heavy. Start with bodyweight exercises or light weights, use mirrors to check posture, and ask trainers for guidance.

Get Started the Right Way: Personal Training is the perfect way to start if you're new to fitness. Learning the right techniques and what works best for you not just sets you up for success, it also prevents and reduces the likelihood of injuries. Learn more about Personal Training at GoFit.

3. Doing Too Much, Too Soon

Mistake: Hitting the gym daily, lifting heavy, or jumping into intense workouts without building a foundation.

Why It’s a Problem: Overtraining leads to burnout, soreness, and a higher risk of injury. Your body needs time to adapt.

Fix It: Start with 3–4 workouts per week, allowing recovery days in between. Follow a structured plan focusing on progressive overload—gradually increasing weights or reps over time.

4. Only Focusing on Cardio

Mistake: Spending hours on the treadmill but avoiding strength training.

Why It’s a Problem: While cardio is great for heart health, strength training builds muscle, boosts metabolism, and improves overall strength.

Fix It: Balance your routine with both cardio and resistance training. Aim for at least two strength sessions per week using bodyweight, dumbbells, or resistance bands.

5. Not Having a Plan

Mistake: Walking into the gym without a set routine, hopping from machine to machine.

Why It’s a Problem: Without structure, it’s harder to track progress or work all muscle groups effectively.

Fix It: Follow a beginner fitness foundation workout plan that includes strength, cardio, and flexibility exercises. Apps, trainers, or gym programs can help you stay on track.

6. Neglecting Recovery & Sleep

Mistake: Not prioritising rest days or skimping on sleep.

Why It’s a Problem: Muscles grow and recover during rest. Poor sleep affects performance, energy levels, and overall progress.

Fix It: Schedule at least one full rest day per week and aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night. Post-workout nutrition also plays a key role in recovery.

7. Not Fuelling Your Body Properly

Mistake: Training on an empty stomach or eating the wrong foods post-workout.

Why It’s a Problem: Nutrition fuels workouts, aids muscle repair, and supports overall health.

Fix It: Eat a balanced pre-workout meal with carbs and protein (e.g., banana with peanut butter). After training, refuel with protein-rich meals like chicken, eggs, or a smoothie.

8. Comparing Yourself to Others

Mistake: Feeling discouraged because you’re not lifting as much or running as fast as someone else.

Why It’s a Problem: Everyone has a different starting point. Comparing yourself to advanced lifters or athletes can lower motivation.

Fix It: Focus on your own progress and celebrate small wins. Fitness is a long-term journey - compete with yourself, not others.
