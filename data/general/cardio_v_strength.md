For most of us, a few jogs around the block and a couple of sessions hefting dumbbells comprises a solid fitness routine. Yes, we could all do more, but as long as we’re ticking off both cardio and strength training a few days a week, we’re covering all the bases, right?
Certain fitness aficionados would have you believe otherwise. Ever since mankind lifted its first kettlebell overhead, there have been those who swear by strength training and hate on running, and those who think cardiovascular work is a gift from above.
Why strength training is good for you
We don’t have to hold your hand through this one, do we? Strength training is the bee’s knees. Don’t believe us? Actual science has proven it’s great for:
Increasing strength (ovi)
Increasing lean muscle tissue
Increasing metabolism
Increasing bone density
Reducing your risk of injuries
Improving sporting performance
Improving your immune system
“Strength training is essential for vitality and overall well-being,” adds Adam Enaz, NHS-registered clinical dietician, and founder of the Body Transformation Programme.
It even has an apparent edge over slogging away on a treadmill. “Many of my clients initially prioritise cardio for fat loss, but recent evidence suggests that strength training is equally effective in reducing abdominal fat,” Enaz explains.
“In fact, a Harvard study tracking 10,500 men over 12 years found that those who emphasised strength training maintained lower fat percentages in the long term,” he continues. “While cardio burns more calories, strength training helps prevent muscle loss, which is crucial for sustaining calorie expenditure and managing waistlines, especially as individuals age.”
Cardio is just as vital
Cardio – that’s your running, your cross trainer, assault bike, your skipping, your torturous HIIT sweat sessions etc – has an equally flashy fitness CV:

Improved VO2 max – i.e. your body’s ability to process oxygen during exercise
Lowered chance of stroke
Lower resting blood pressure
Increased calorie burn
Reduction in body weight
Increased endorphins and better mood
“Cardio primarily targets the heart and lungs, enhancing their efficiency,” explains Enaz. “A plethora of studies have established a strong connection between cardio and a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, an uplifted mood, sharpened cognitive function, and an elongated lifespan. Moreover, it aids in weight management by torching calories and revving up metabolism.”

Strength training vs cardio: which one to prioritise
Tricky question, this, given the usual caveat that we’re all of different body types, ages, abilities and each have different fitness goals and levels of experience. That being said, Luiz Silva, head of fitness and wellbeing at Castle Royle, has some thoughts.

“I recommend a minimum of two full-body sessions per week, or three/four sessions where you split the training into an upper body session and lower body sessions,” he says.

Luiz adds that exercise Bible Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance by MCardle, Katch & Katch recommends cycles of 12 weeks in which you vary your focus between volume, intensity and technique.

As for cardio, if you aren’t trying to run a marathon – and if you are, you’ll have your own, specialised programme – Silva recommends two cardio sessions a week. But it depends on intensity.

“Ideally, cardio sessions should have a mixture of intensities, from low-moderate intensity sessions that could last a bit longer, to higher intensity sessions that can be over quite quickly,” he says.

Heart rate monitors are your friend here. “Wear a monitor and work in your heart rate 'zones' of intensity, which usually vary between 60-100 percent of your max HR,” advises Luiz.

Does cardio actually kill your gains?
Part of the reason the cardio/weights divide can be so contentious is the idea that cardio kills muscle gains. But it might be a chicken and egg sort of situation. Are runners skinny because they run so much, or because they’re not focused on lifting in the same way, say, a CrossFitter might be?

“Cardio exercises place a high energy demand in the body and require a regular supply of energy in the form of muscle glycogen,” Luiz explains. “Your muscle glycogen stock is limited, once it's gone, the body needs to generate new glycogen using glucose. When cardio lasts a long time, there's less glucose available, so the body tends to break muscle protein to convert into energy (it's easier than using fat).”

So, there is some truth in the idea, especially if you’re doing lots and lots of cardio each week. But it isn’t exclusively cardio that’s stopping you from bulking up.

“Lifting weights five times a week plus lots of cardio on top probably means the glycogen storage is not replenished between sessions, so the muscles may be starting without a 'full tank’,” says Luiz.

In other words, your nutrition could be equally to blame.

What your diet should look like
If you’re lifting weights and running, it makes sense to keep carbs high so you can fuel your workouts and help your muscles grow.

Enaz is quick to dispel the myth that extensive exercise increases appetite, pointing to a recent study review that found 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is sufficient for maximal muscle gain.
“This is significant as lots of people wrongly assume that consuming more protein automatically results in greater muscle growth,” says Enaz.

“Strength training and cardio each come with their own dietary needs,” says Enaz. “For strength training, adequate protein supports muscle repair and growth, with carbohydrates providing energy during workouts.” Protein shakes, meanwhile, have been proven to have a significant impact on your gains.

For cardio enthusiasts, Enaz recommends keeping carbs high, but also thinking more about healthy fats from seeds, nuts and fish. “This combination sustains endurance and optimises performance,” he says, adding that proper hydration is “fundamental” for all types of exercise.

Overall, which is best for you – strength training vs cardio
When it comes to exercise, anything is better than nothing, and as we’ve found, both cardio and strength training have significant health benefits. It might feel like a cop out, but when it comes to which you should focus on, it really should come down to two factors: your fitness goals and abilities, and which you most enjoy.

“For general fitness and overall health maintenance, two or three weight sessions per week is typically adequate,” says Enaz. “For those striving for aesthetic improvements and maximal muscle development, increasing the frequency to four or five sessions per week can be beneficial.”

As for cardio, Enaz explains that his clients often focus on aesthetic goals, which leads to a focus on weight training with brief cardio sessions of 10-15 minutes following each session. “Placing cardio after weight training is crucial to mitigate any interference it might pose on muscle gain,” says Enaz.

The thinking on whether cardio before or after weight training helps muscle growth is yet to be settled, with proponents on both sides. So it’s probably best not to worry about that too much within the context of your weekly fitness plan.

A balanced weekly plan
If you want a workout regime that favours muscle growth and cardiovascular fitness, Luiz’ advice would be to aim for three 60 to 75-minute sessions per week, covering everything while allowing for plentiful rest and recovery.

“Full body workouts not only will tackle the muscle tears that we require to generate growth, but also will have a better energy output, especially if done in supersets (back to back exercises then rest),” he says. “The cardio at the end helps to further 'empty the tanks' in your muscles, while working the heart in a way that will increase its efficiency.”

Here's how to break it down:

If you’re training 2-3 days per week, go for a mixture of strength and cardio.

45 minutes strength training
15 to 30 minutes of cardio (HIIT or something more steady paced like the elliptical would work, depending on your fitness level)
If you’re training 4 days per week.

Option 1:

Three full body workout sessions
One Cardio session
Option 2:

Upper body session + 15 min cardio at the end x 2
Lower body session x1
Cardio session
The following week, alternate and do LB x 2 and UB x 1
If you’re training 5 days per week

Option 1:

Three full body workout sessions
One Cardio session
Option 2:

Upper body session + 15 Min CV in the end x2
Lower body session x2
Cardio session
Crucially, listen to your body. There might be times where you love cardio and times where you’re obsessed with lifting weights. As long as you’re having fun and avoiding injury, ultimately there is no wrong way to train.
