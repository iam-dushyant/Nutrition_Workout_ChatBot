1. SET SOME MOTIVATING GYM GOALS

Whatever your goal is, whether it's to get stronger, improve your general fitness, or lose weight, having a clear purpose of why you're working out can help to guide your focus in the gym. Set some goals that will leave you feeling proud with the help of our How to set up fitness goals guide. 

2. HAVE AN INSPIRING WORKOUT PLAYLIST

Research shows that training to music can help give your workout a boost.

Before you go to the gym, you can set up a workout playlist with your favourite tunes that will get you raring to go or get some inspiration from places such as Spotify, where we have compiled the most popular home workout songs here!

Jasmin finds that "a good workout playlist keeps me in the zone and focused on my workout".

3. PLAN YOUR WORKOUTS AHEAD OF TIME

Preparing ahead of your workouts, such as packing your gym back the night before, can help to make it easier to make it to the gym. Make a list of things you would typically make excuses for to help you identify what steps you can take to reduce challenges or things that might prevent you from going to the gym. For example if you sometimes find you don't have clean gym clothes to train in, making sure you check to do your laundry the day before, so you have fresh clothes to workout in can be the difference between either getting or not getting your workout in, which over time, can impact the results you see.

Also, having a workout plan so you know what you're working out on what day of the week can help give you structure to your week and workout habits. 

If you have a diary or calendar, planning and adding your workouts ahead of time can help you schedule workouts around your day to fit your needs, rather than just relying on motivation.

Jasmin finds that having a weekly workout plan split by which muscle group she is going to train helps her to fit in her workouts for the time she has whilst including enough time to recover from her workouts.

A typical week for her looks like:

Monday - legs (squats)
Tuesday - upper body (chest and triceps)
Wednesday legs (deadlifts)
Thursday - rest day
Friday - upper body (back and biceps)
Saturday - legs (squats)
Sunday - rest
By allocating set days of when you're going to train can also help with time-management and making sure you're able to balance scheduling workout time and time to do other things.

You can always take it one step further, by setting up a plan of what you're going to be doing for each workout.

Jasmin likes to have a clear plan of what exercises, sets, reps, and weight she's going to be doing in her workout, so that she can track her workouts and progress over time - you'll find out why this can help in maintaining motivation and sticking to exercise habits further down in this article.

4. INCLUDE MOTIVATING EXERCISES YOU ENJOY

Exercising can be enjoyable - it doesn't have to always be intense, challenging or boring! By including things you enjoy doing, it's going to be much easier to stick to. For example if you enjoy a cycle class, why not go to a cycle class once or a couple times a week and add deadlifting into one of your weight sessions every week?

Jasmin enjoys training back and biceps and we can see that in her weekly routine, she has included this on Friday, which gives her a training session to really look forward to in her week.

5. SET SOME GYM BOUNDARIES

It can often be easy to get sidetracked, especially with our mobile phones. Setting some rules to yourself, such as putting your phone on Do Not Disturb mode during your sessions, can help you stick to your rest times, and avoid making your workouts unnecessarily longer than they need to be.

Jasmin says: "I will not reply to messages or check social media when I'm training as it ruins my focus and so I don't take a longer rest time than is necessary, which helps me get most out of my training."

6. TRACK YOUR GYM PROGRESS

If you're going to the gym and repeatedly doing the same things over and over, it's likely that at some point you're going to start feeling demotivated. That's when noticing and seeing progress can really help with sustaining your workout habits. When you know your efforts in the gym are making a positive impact, whether it's on your strength, energy levels, mood, fitness etc, then it's a lot easier to see why you would want to continue putting in the effort.

Jasmin likes to track progress by logging in her workouts, recording the reps and weights she's lifting. Writing this down helps her have a clear idea of the progress she is making, and any changes she might wish to help her in achieving her goals.

Goal setting can be a really useful tool, whether you're just starting out or an experienced gym goer. Setting yourself an aim can help to guide your focus and also help to drastically improve your chances of reaching your desired outcomes.

Here are our 5 tips to help you set your fitness goals, achieve them and enhance your skills:

Identify your overall aim

It is important to make your overall aim something that is important to you and not to others. If you don't do this, you will find your motivation lacking before you know it as your aim is not your own. Your long-term goal will turn into a great motivator and help give you direction with your training. For example, you might set a target of running a 5k or another performance-based goal such as achieving a press up.

Figure out how to achieve your aim

Once you have your main aim you need to figure out how to reach it. Everyone's goals are different and will require a different approach. As an example, if you want to be more active, you could think about going for a walk first thing in the morning before starting work. Simple tricks like this go a long way to making a difference and it is important that you work out how you will achieve these goals around your current lifestyle. Failing to consider your lifestyle in the planning stage will create further barriers along the way.

Set specific, smaller goals to help

Setting smaller goals along the way will help keep motivation levels high, making you more likely to reach the ultimate aim. If you are unsure on how to attain your overall goal or how it would be best to approach it, don't be afraid to ask for help. A personal trainer can be a great way to kickstart your journey. It's important to remember that short term goals will help you stay on track towards reaching your overall aim.

Monitor your progress regularly

Setting smaller goals is only worthwhile if you are monitoring your progress on a regular basis. Write down the weights you lift and repetitions for each exercise, so you know where you are at each week and remain focused. If you choose not to monitor your progress then you are far more likely to focus on your failures, whereas if you have your progress tracked you will be able to see all the positive impacts you have made.

Adapt to changing circumstances

Remember it is important to be flexible. Unless you are in a career where you have access to the gym all day, then it is more than likely that life will interrupt your schedule at some point along the way. Adapt to the change and think on your feet, as you can always continue making progress. Just remember your goals don't always have to be set for a really specific time. The important thing is to keep your goals in mind as it will help retain your focus and increase the likelihood of achieving them.

Don't be too hard on yourself

Your overall aim is not going to happen overnight, it's important to remember this is a long-term goal. There will be days that you find tough and don't want to go, but if you can go and do something you will not only feel better for it, you will feel less guilty in the long run. Don't give up, keep setting smaller goals and believe in your own ability. Looking back on where you were when you just started can be a way to help you remember and realise just how far you've come during periods you feel like you're not progressing.
