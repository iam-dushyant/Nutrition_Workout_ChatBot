Losing fat doesn’t automatically lead to muscle gain. When you’re losing weight, your body uses fat for energy. To maintain or build muscle, try to do regular strength training and eat more protein.
Trying to lose fat and build muscle is a common goal for many people.
Among the many fitness myths out there, one of the most popular is the idea that you can turn fat into muscle through weight training and a healthy lifestyle. However, the process of fat loss and muscle building isn’t quite that simple.
This article explains how to lose fat and build muscle in a healthy, sustainable way.
Does fat turn into muscle?
The simple answer is no. Turning fat into muscle is physiologically impossible, as muscle and fat are made up of different cells. A good analogy to this would be that you cannot turn a banana into an apple — they’re two separate things.
The difference between muscle and fat
Muscle comes in three forms: skeletal, cardiac (heart), and smooth (mostly found in the intestine). The muscle most often thought of in regards to body composition is skeletal muscle, which is attached to bones by tendons and allows for voluntary movement of the body (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).
Skeletal muscle tissue comprises bundles of muscle fibers known as myofibrils. Myofibrils contain smaller fibers that consist of long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. Amino acids contain a unique nitrogen group in their chemical structure (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).
Contrarily, body fat — also known as adipose tissue — comprises triglycerides, which consist of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acid chains. Though various types of body fat exist, fat is exclusively made up of various carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).
Since muscle and fat cells have different chemical makeups, neither can be converted into the other (6Trusted Source).
What changes during weight loss?
Weight loss is most often a combination of losing fat, muscle, and glycogen stores (water weight). Ideally, most weight loss should come from fat loss (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
To lose weight, you must achieve a calorie deficit by eating fewer calories than your body needs daily, increasing physical activity to burn calories, or a combination of both.
Yet, too large of a calorie deficit can lead to a rapid muscle mass loss, as the body will break down muscle to be used as an emergency fuel source. Thus, a moderate deficit of around 500 calories, or 10–20% of your total calorie needs per day, is recommended (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).
During a moderate calorie deficit, body fat is used as fuel to support the body’s regular functions.
Triglycerides stored in fat cells are broken down and sent to the mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the body’s main source of energy (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).
Known as beta oxidation, this process produces carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. These are both exhaled during breathing and excreted via urine and sweat.
As such, when fat is burned, it’s not turned into muscle but rather broken down into usable energy (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).
To preserve muscle mass during weight loss, it’s recommended to engage in strength training at least 2–3 times per week. Furthermore, eating a protein-rich diet has been shown to reduce muscle loss during a calorie deficit (9Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).
How to lose fat
If you’re looking to lose fat and build muscle, here’s how you can do it in a healthy, sustainable way.
To lose fat, the body must be in a calorie deficit. You can achieve a calorie deficit by increasing your physical activity, eating fewer calories, or a combination of both. A modest increase in physical activity and decrease in calorie intake is most sustainable (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).
Consuming mostly minimally processed, whole foods rich in fiber, healthy fats, and protein will help you achieve a calorie deficit without feeling deprived or hungry (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).
Furthermore, it’s best to incorporate both cardiovascular and strength training, such as lifting weights, using resistance bands, or Pilates, 5–7 days per week (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).
Examples of moderate intensity cardio include walking, running, or biking for over 20 minutes while still being able to talk with limited struggle.
Meanwhile, strength training helps preserve and build muscle and can increase the body’s metabolic rate for upwards of 72 hours. This means that even after a good strength training session, your body will still burn extra calories (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).
What’s more, muscle is more metabolically active than fat, meaning having more muscle on your body can further support weight loss by burning more calories (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).
Thus, combining these two forms of exercise along with a minimally processed, whole food diet will support the body in achieving a calorie deficit.
If you’re trying to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, it’s important to engage in strength training. Strength training combined with a high protein diet helps build new muscle cells through a process known as muscle protein synthesis.
Most experts recommend at least 2–3 strength training sessions per week that target multiple muscle groups, along with adequate rest days to allow for muscle rebuilding (22Trusted Source).
Muscle is built from a diet high in dietary nitrogen, mostly found in protein-rich foods. Protein from food is broken down and converted into amino acids to support muscle building (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).
To maintain muscle during weight loss, be sure to eat enough protein and avoid a large calorie deficit. Most people should aim to get 0.6–0.9 grams of protein per pound (1.4–2.0 grams per kg) of body weight daily, or around 20–40 grams of protein per meal (15Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).
