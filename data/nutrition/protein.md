Protein may be a buzzword in wellness and bodybuilding, but it’s also essential. So, in some ways, one nutrition expert doesn’t mind that people are paying attention to grams of protein on nutrition labels.
“Protein is the building block for muscles,” said Anupama Chawla, MD, a pediatric gastroenterologist at at Stony Brook Medicine.
Indeed, research from 2018Trusted Source indicates that muscle protein breaks down in the human body. Consuming more protein is essential to rebuilding — and even building more — muscle.
As you might expect, consuming adequate protein in conjunction with strength training helps you build muscle. And that’s part of the reason why people are honing in on this nutrient when purchasing food.
“It has become a fad because of the significant [focus] on weight loss and muscle building,” Chawla told Healthline. “It’s become an ‘in thing’ where everybody is reading the protein content.”
But pump the breaks before pouring an entire tub of protein powder into tomorrow morning’s breakfast smoothie. Experts and research indicate that there is such a thing as too much protein.
Though Chawla is glad protein is getting attention because of its importance to the human diet, she cautioned against going to extremes, such as consuming an all-meat diet. “Too little is not good, and too much is not good,” Chawla said.
How much should you be consuming? That depends. Here’s what the research, health experts, and guidelines say.
The minimum recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of proteinTrusted Source per kilogram of body weight per day. Most people actually need more, especially those who exercise regularly. This means how much protein you should eat daily varies from person to person.
“A person weighing 140 pounds needs [at least] 51 grams of protein per day, and another person weighing 200 pounds needs [at least] 73 grams of protein per day,” Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, a senior dietitian with UCLA Medical Center, told Healthline.
Trista Best, a registered dietitian at Balance One Supplements, adds that this number equates to about 10 to 35% of our daily recommended caloric intake.
But, as with many aspects of medicine, there’s room for nuance. For example, age is one reason to up the protein intake.
“Older adults [around ages 65 to 70] should eat a little more, roughly 1 gram per kilogram or -.45 gram per pound of body weight because they don’t absorb quite as well and are more prone to muscle loss and bone fractures,” Hunnes said.
Some athletes also may require more to support their training regimen and physical activity.
A 2016 position statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine recommended the following guidelines for protein intake among physically active individuals:
Physically active people take in 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight or 0.5 to 0.9 grams per pound of body weight, whether they are endurance or strength athletes.
Whether protein is consumed on the high or low end of these recommended amounts should be based on intensity of exercise or calorie restriction.
Athletes should consume 0.25 to 0.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight no more than two hours post-exercise to increase muscle.
Chawla noted that athletes who consume 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should do so under the guidance of a medical professional to ensure the body, particularly the kidneys, continues to function optimally.
“This is because the kidneys have to work harder to eliminate the waste by-products from protein metabolism,” Kimberley Rose-Francis, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Southern Florida, told Healthline.
Hunnes recommended consuming no more than 1.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.
When you consume more protein than needed, your body may store the excess calories as fat.
Rose-Francis noted that consuming too much protein — over 2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily — may come with risks, such as un unwanted weight gain.
In addition, people living with or at risk for kidney disease may also experience azotemia (kidney malfunction).
A 2020 studyTrusted Source indicates that high protein diets did not increase kidney or bone health risks but called for longer clinical trials.
However, as Rose-Francis pointed out, a high protein diet was classified as 1.07–1.60 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, not 2 grams.
Additionally, Best noted that people consuming too much protein for their weight and activity level may experience the following:
irritability
dehydration
fatigue
nausea
“The best, or healthiest, sources of protein are those from lean animal meats or plants,” Best said. These include:
poultry (3 oz. of turkey contains about 25 grams of proteinTrusted Source)
fish ( 3 oz. of salmon contains about 22 grams of proteinTrusted Source)
eggs (one large hardboiled egg contains about 6 grams of proteinTrusted Source)
Plant-based proteins, like beans, tofu, and lentils, provide an alternative for vegetarians and vegans, but these sources are not always equivalent.
“There are 20 amino acids, nine of which are essential, meaning they are required to be taken in through the diet because the body cannot make them,” Best said.
“Animal proteins have these nine already, which makes them complete proteins. However, not all plant sources are complete proteins.”
That doesn’t mean they aren’t beneficial or that you need to consume animal-based proteins to get adequate amounts to build or maintain muscle and overall health. You may just need to combine several sources of protein to keep the necessary amount.
“This sometimes means you’ll have to combine plant foods to get all nine essential amino acids. For instance, rice and beans combine to make a complete protein while quinoa is a complete protein in itself,” Best said.
What about all those protein bars and powders? Chawla isn’t a fan of the former.
“Some of these bars have 20 to 30 grams of sugar,” she said.
Chawla is more amenable to powders, particularly whey, for athletes needing more protein. But she cautions that everyone should refrain from being hyper-focused on protein for strength and overall health.
“People get stuck on protein sources and forget that they are not getting adequate calories from other sources,” she said, noting complex carbohydrates as an adequate protein source.
A 2022 meta-analysis of 69 studies suggested sticking to the lower end of the position statement’s recommendations.
Based on previous research, authors indicated that eating 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, which equates to 0.7 grams of protein per pound, should be enough to build strength when combined with resistance training. The point about resistance training is a reminder that muscle mass is not simply a product of protein intake.
“If someone wants to build more muscle, they need to up the intensity of their strength training — higher weights, higher reps, or both — and break down their muscle fibers. Then, they need to eat a healthy diet,” Hunnes said.
Another 2022 studyTrusted Source of more than 4,800 Chinese individuals 60 and older suggested that male participants who consumed more than 78 grams per day and females who consumed 68 grams daily had the most protection against low muscle mass.
They consumed less than 20 grams of protein per meal, and the majority of protein came from plant-based sources.
In addition, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysisTrusted Source of protein intake in healthy adults suggested that 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day could help individuals under 45 years old increase body mass slightly. People older than 45 only saw marginal increases.
A 2020 systemic review and meta-analysis of previous randomized control trials indicated that upping daily protein intake by up to 3.5 grams per kilogram of body weight over the course of several meals could help people grow or maintain muscle mass.
Even in developed countries like the United States, research suggests that many people are still not getting enough protein.
Inadequate protein intake decreases muscle mass and strength. According to Rose-Francis, other signs of protein deficiency may include:
weakened immune system
malnutrition
edema due to fluid imbalance
hair thinning
Protein is key for muscle growth and maintenance, but consuming too much protein may pose health risks.
The minimum recommendation for daily protein intake is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, but most people need more, especially if they exercise regularly.
Be wary of consuming too much protein, however, which could result in weight gain.

**Source:** [THE SMARTEST WAY TO USE PROTEIN TO BUILD MUSCLE (SCIENCE EXPLAINED)](https://jeffnippard.com/blogs/news/the-smartest-way-to-use-protein-to-build-muscle-science-explained)
Maybe a good starting point is to look at the standard recommendation from the World Health Organization. As it pertains to general health, the WHO recommends just 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram (0.36 grams per pound) of bodyweight. Following this guidance, an 80-kilogram (roughly 180-pound) person would only need about 65 grams of protein per day.
On a typical western diet, it’s difficult to not achieve this recommendation. For example, consider that a ground turkey and rice bowl with a glass of milk has 65 grams of protein and  thereby would have you covered for the day. However, this recommendation doesn’t consider the extra needs from a weight training lifestyle, nor that many ‘protein experts’ have called for an increase, given the abundance of evidence showing health benefits with higher protein intakes. 
The Sports Nutrition Research is perfectly clear in showing that this amount of protein simply won’t be enough to support, much less maximize, muscle growth. For that goal, we’ll need more.
How much more protein you precisely need depends on whether or not you’re bulking, cutting, or doing a recomp phase. Keep in mind that this variable applies to both men and women.
If you’re BULKING, your body is well-fed, meaning it’s much less likely to break down muscle tissue as a fuel source. There are plenty of carbs and fats to burn first. For this reason, you generally need less protein when bulking. Here, the best research recommends 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight or 0.7 to 1 gram per pound of body weight, per day.
If you’re CUTTING, your body’s not only getting fewer calories from food, but you also have less body fat and less glycogen as fuel reserves. It stands then, that your body is much more likely to break down muscle tissue as a source of calories. To offset this, the best data suggests increasing protein intake while cutting to 1.8 to 2.7 grams per kilogram of bodyweight or 0.8 to 1.2 grams per pound of bodyweight.
When on a RECOMP phase, you’re trying to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, while setting your calories around maintenance intake. I think most people can simply use the same protein figures as when bulking because at maintenance, you’re also at a low risk of muscle loss, assuming your training is on point.
However, it’s worth considering that there may be some advantages to going a bit higher on a recomp phase, especially if you’re in a light deficit or more advanced.
In the past, I’ve used this sliding model as a guide for recomp because it uses lean body mass instead of total body weight, making it more individualized, especially for those who hold more body fat. 
Unfortunately, the extra step of subtracting body fat has confused some people. To remedy this,  via researcher Eric Helms, I’ve come up with a simpler solution. If you’re overweight or obese, you can simply aim for one gram of protein per centimeter in height. 
Following this formula, if you’re six feet or 183 cm tall, you’d aim for 183 grams of protein. This works shockingly well, especially if you’re at a higher body fat.
This brings us to a second question: “How much protein can you absorb in a single meal?” The simple answer is... ALL OF IT.
Your body can absorb an enormous amount of protein in a single meal, likely more than you could even comfortably eat. Although absorption simply refers to the passage of nutrients from the small intestine into the bloodstream, it’s important to understand that just because protein is being absorbed, doesn’t mean it’s being used to build muscle.
The real question is “How much protein can you USE in a single meal?”
This is where there’s some controversy. The earliest research suggested that 20 to 25 grams of protein in a single meal was all you needed to max out the anabolic response. It went on to proclaim that going above that amount didn’t do anything extra for muscle growth.
Although often cited, let’s not be too quick to jump on board with this. For a couple of reasons,  I’m skeptical of this figure.
First, on the anecdotal side, there’s a huge intermittent fasting community who seem to be getting plenty jacked from just eating one or two meals per day, with upwards of 50 to 100 grams of protein per meal. Given their muscularity and gains, it’s highly unlikely that most of that protein is going to waste.
Second, more recent research has challenged the idea of a 20 to 25-gram upper limit. The 2016 study referenced below showed higher muscle protein synthesis with 40 grams of whey, versus 20 grams of whey, taken after a full-body workout.
