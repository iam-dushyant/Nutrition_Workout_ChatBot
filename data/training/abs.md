**Source:** [24 Ab Exercises and Workouts to Build a Strong Core](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a757285/best-ab-exercises/)
There’s a reason we think it’s a good idea to practise ab exercises and ab workouts. Because while a set of strong abs are often coveted by Men’s Health readers, the benefits of a cobblestone core stretch far beyond aesthetics.

Your abs are also one of the most important muscles in your body and having a stronger core will help your strength and your lifts — improving your numbers on the bench press, overhead work, deadlifts and squats. An effective ab workout will also improve your proficiency in any sport and help you to maintain good posture.

While we know the well-worn adage that abs are built in the kitchen, if aesthetics are your goal, it’s safe to say that ab exercises deserve as much time and attention as any muscle group in your body. That said, it’s important that you’re not just putting in work in your nutrition, but that you’re also working intelligently in your training sessions, which is why we’ve collated the best exercises for the abdomen and ab workouts to get your mid-section firing.
Ab Exercises Benefits
There are almost countless benefits of having a fortified mid-section that are applicable to almost everyone — whether you swear by a weekend 5K, are a devout CrossFitter or just want to become faster, fitter and stronger. Here are just a few.

You'll Hit Personal Bests:
Hit a training plateau? Squats stalled? Deadlifts doing nothing? It could be your (lack of) accessory work and a weak core that's holding you back. A strong mid-section will become the sturdy foundation on which your compound moves should be built. Engage in ab workouts and it should help you lift heavier weights for more reps, generate more force through your body and keep your back safe.
Your Posture Will Improve with Ab Exercises:
Simply put, core training can help you stand up a little straighter. A study in the Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies found that a programme of core training positively affected the posture of male volleyball players.

You'll Have Better Balance:
'A strong core keeps your torso in a more stable position whenever you move, whether you're playing sports or just doing chores,' sports medicine specialist Dr J. Christopher Mendler said to Men's Health. This will translate into both your training and every day movements.

You Can Dominate at Your Sport:
As a strong core will help you transfer more power to your limbs, you'll be able to punch harder, drive further and, if you happen to be a swimmer, power through the water. 'Core training makes you a better athlete in just about any strength or speed sport,' says Stuart McGill, professor of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo.
You'll Become More Agile with Ab Exercises:
A study in the Universal Journal of Educational Research revealed that athletes who performed thirteen core movements three times a week for eight weeks benefited from a significant boost in explosive force and agility.
The Anatomy of Your Abs
Upper Abs
To specifically target your upper abs, your objective is to focus on exercises that involve pulling your chest towards your pelvis. Sure, they'll hit your whole core, but they'll smoke your upper abs too.
Try: V-Ups
How:

Starting on your back, extend your legs and keep your arms by your side
In one movement, lift your upper-body, arms and legs to balance on your tailbone, forming a 'V' shape
Lower your body down. That's one rep
Middle Abs
Part of the 'rectus abdominis' — your 'six-pack' muscles — the middle abs are crucial for flexing your spine and bring your pelvis and ribcage closer. Get your middle ab exercises right and you'll be building a stronger core from the get-go.
Try: Hollow Holds
How:

Lie on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you and your feet together. Extend your arms above your head
Tilt your pelvis forward until your lower back is flush against the floor
Maintaining this position in your lower back, raise your arms and legs a few inches off the floor to create a straight line from fingers to toes
Lower Abs
What: Your lower abs are vital for maintaining strength across your whole core. Often a sought after area to work, here's a quick coaching tip:
Try: Heel Tap Crunches
How:

Lie on your back with your heels near your glutes.
Brace your core, lift your shoulders off the floor and reach down to touch your right heel with your right hand, then your left heel with your other hand. That's one rep.
Why: This exercise predominantly targets the lower abs, obliques and hip flexors. By adjusting the distance between your heels and glutes, you can make it harder or easier. Control the movement by making slow extensions to maintain tension.
